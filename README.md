Drawbacks of existing system


Lack of pharmacist consultation: E-commerce medical stores may not provide the opportunity to consult with a pharmacist, who can answer questions, address concerns, and offer guidance on potential interactions with other medications.

Counterfeit medication risk: Since you can’t physically inspect the medications you’re purchasing online, there’s a potential risk of receiving counterfeit drugs, which can be ineffective or even harmful.

Delivery time limitations: If you need medication urgently, waiting for a delivery might not be an option. This can be a drawback for medication needed to manage chronic conditions or sudden illnesses.

Requirement Analysis

	
Requirement analysis is significant and essential activity after elicitation. We analyze, refine, and scrutinize the gathered requirement to make consistent and unambiguous requirements. This activity reviews all requirements and may provide a graphical view of the entire system. After the completion of the analysis, it is expected that the understandability of the project may improve significantly. Here, we may also use the interaction with the customer to clarity points of confusion and to understand which requirement is more important than others.

Fact finding techniques: Fact finding is process of collection of data and information based on techniques which contain sampling of existing documents, research, observation, questionnaires, interviews, prototyping and joint requirement planning. System analyst uses suitable fact-finding techniques to develop and implement the current existing system. Collecting required fact are very important to apply tools in system development life cycle because tools cannot be used efficiently and effectively without proper extracting from fact-finding techniques are ued in the early stage of system Development Life Cycle including system analysis phase, design and post implementation review.

There are common fact-finding techniques:

1.	Sampling of existing documentation, forms and databases
2.	Observation of the work environment
3.	Interviews


Interview is the most commonly used technique to collect information from the face-to-face interviews. The purpose of interview is to find, verify, clary  facts, motivate end-user involved, identify requirements and gather ideas and opinios. The role of interview includes interviewer who is system analyst and interviewer who are system owner or user. Interviewing technique needs good communication skills for interaction between system and user.


Another fact-finding technique is observation. In this technique, system analyst participates in the organization, studies the flow of documents, and applies the existing.
 
Feasibility Study


	A feasibility study is undertaken to determine the possibility or probability of either improving the existing system or developing a completely new system.

	It helps to obtain an overview of the problem to get rough assessment of whether feasible solution exists.


	This is essential to avoid committing large recourse to project and then repent on later.

	Need for feasibility study:


The Feasibility study is needed to :

•	Answer the question a new system is to be installed or not?
•	Determined the potential of the existing system.
•	Improved the existing system.
•	Know what should be embedded involved in project.
•	Avoid costly repairs at a later stage when the system is implemented.
•	Avoid Crash implemented of a new system.
•	Avoid the ‘hardware Approach’ that is getting a computer first and then deciding how to use it.

	There are aspects in feasibility study portion of the preliminary investigation

•	Technical Feasibility
•	Economic Feasibility and
•	Operational feasibility of the project

 
System Testing
	
It is measure to check the quality o software during development.
To detect the errors in requirements, design and coding phases.
This phase starts with test plan, which gives all activities to be done for testing.

Testing can be done by:

	Underline testing it is a process to test an individual module of software.
	Integrations testing: it is a process to perform a testing after combine modules.
	System testing: It is a process to check the whether the software is working according to user requirement or not.
	Acceptance testing: It is a process to check software with actual data.


Method of Testing:

	Functional Testing: It is also known as black box testing. It is not known what is inside code.
	Structural Testing: The test data is given to check the logic of the code called as glass box testing.

For Example:

To check that format of output is as per requirement is functional, but to check that negative no is allowed or not is structural.

This phase ends with the test report which specifies the different test data and its output and the action taken of error is found.


 
System Implementation

System acquisition:	
	
	An important part of system acquisition is the actual purchase of goods and services. It involves the purchase of hardware. Packaged software and software services are available. Here system analyst and designer work together to determine best policy for this purchasing.

Programming:

	Computer programmer performs programming. Programming is the writing coded instruction, testing each segment of the code and testing the entire computer programmed once it is complete. Normally a team of programmer work under the direction by system analyst.

Testing:

	It consists of putting together the various coded pieces of a design, testing them and correction the parts of the code or the design that are not correct.

This requires
1.	Training of personnel.
2.	 Modifying parts of the old system.
3.	Running parallel both the system until everything goes as planned.

Documentation:
	Documentation means the written from about how a system design or function. It includes.

•	Design Documentation: It describes the overall system design and it includes system flowchart, all input/output formats, file description, control requirements and report specification.
•	Program Documentation: It consists of programming specification like program logic.
•	Training Documentation: It includes user training and materials to be used conversion and the installation of new system.
•	Operation Documentation: It consists of instruction from normal operation as well as from handling problems.
•	User Reference Documentation: It should provide quick, clear answer like a dictionary.

 
System Maintenance

Two types of maintenance:
	
•	Adaptive maintenance: It means that there is not any error in the system, but there may be some changes required by the clients in the input or the output formats, or in the requirements analysis, which is found after the testing is overall such operation are done here.

•	Corrective maintenance: It means the software is giving some errors and they are solved. In the maintenance, the testing is required. This means that when the changes are made in software, we have to again check it with old data, which is working.


 
Introduction of PHP



PHP is a scripting language that lets you create dynamic web pages.PHP is a server-side scripting language. The PHP language interpreter must be installed on the server-side in order to execute PHP commands.

The output of the interpreter execution is sent back to the client that requested the page. Thus, a dynamic web page is created.

PHP started as a personal project by Resumes Leadwort called PHP/FI. The Language gained popularity and was completely rewritten by a number of programmers. The PHP3.0 was born.

Now, PHP3.0 is one of the hottest scripting languages the web, with more than 1,000,000 sites making use of its capabilities. Currently, PHP4.0 is taking over.

In this tutorial we refer exclusively to PHP4.0, thus abbreviation PHP stands always for PHP4.0.
